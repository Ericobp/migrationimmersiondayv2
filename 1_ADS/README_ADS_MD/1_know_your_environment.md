# Know your environment

In this exercise, you perform the following tasks:

- Know the servers
- Test if existing applications are working

&nbsp;

‚úÖ Step-by-step Instructions

### Connect to the AWS Console


**1.** [Click here to go to the EC2 Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Instances:sort=tag:Name)

**2.** Make sure that there are EC2 instances in your environment, and those isntances are with ‚ÄòRunning‚Äô state.

**3.** Once connected to the MID-Bastion server, test if the applications are working.

To test the application, Open Chrome in the MID-Bastion host and connect to the 2 application servers as per defined bellow:

| Application  | Application URL       |
| ---          | ---                   |
| WordPress    | http://wordpress-web/ |
| OFBiz  | https://ofbiz-web:8443/accounting |

You should be able to open the Migration Immersion Day Wordpress blog and a OFBiz ERP management page.

&nbsp;

‚≠êTips

üí° You can use Remote Desktop to access the EC2 Bastion host and then login into the WordPress and OFBiz servers via SSH.

üí° Since this lab simulates a migration from a production environment to AWS, you should only connect to the application servers using the Bastion host.
